YTmp3
=====

For exclusive use to download non-copyrighted tracks like [stuff from this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCht8qITGkBvXKsR1Byln-wA/videos). Using this to download copyrighted tracks is a bad idea apparently.

Usage
-----
* Get [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). Extract bin/{ffmpeg|ffprobe}.exe to the same folder as YTmp3.exe.
* Get [youtube-dl](https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl.exe). Put youtube-dl.exe in the same folder as YTmp3.exe.
* Run YTmp3.exe. Copy urls into the text box, select the destination folder, pick from the available format options and select Download.
